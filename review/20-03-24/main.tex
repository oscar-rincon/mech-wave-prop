\section{Introduction}

Wave propagation is a phenomenon governed by partial differential equations, which hold significant importance across various scientific and engineering domains. However, analytical solutions are not always available for most nonlinear systems, and numerical methods are usually required to approximate the exact solutions. Consequently, these methods have been applied to solve the partial differential equations, achieving the required accuracy \citep{Seriani2020}.

In the field of wave propagation, numerous techniques address wave propagation challenges. Classical methods include spectral, pseudo-spectral, finite-difference, and finite-element methods \citep{Moczo, virieux_review_2011, Igel2017}. In these approaches, the space coordinates are discretized. In the context of mathematical modeling, the primary objective is to ensure that the solution methods are computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy to capture the physical details inherent to the system. However, traditional numerical methods often encounter difficulties when addressing complex problems such as irregular geometries, material changes, and mixed boundary conditions. Therefore, the computational demand associated with many common models in computational mechanics has increased the development of innovative strategies.

Researches conducted with the use of machine learning has considerably grown in the late 2010s, owing to advancements in hardware, such as graphic processing units and data storage technologies. Additionally, the discovery of better training practices for neural networks, and the availability of open-source packages like Tensorflow and Pytorch \citep{abadi_tensorflow_2016,paszke_pytorch_2019}, as well as the availability of Automatic Differentiation in such packages \citep{paszke_automatic_2017,baydin_automatic_2017}. Particularly, deep learning algorithms offer attractive approximation capabilities for any function by mapping the input features to the output targets in a data-driven manner. Additionally, multiple physics-informed neural networks methods have been recently proposed \citep{cuomo_scientific_2022}. Figure \ref{dl-wave_propagation-publications} shows that there has been a marked increase in the number of publications associated with deep learning and wave propagation modeling.

Remarkable reviews have been conducted to address the increasing use of deep learning algorithms across various engineering and scientific disciplines \citep{vadyala_review_2022,deng_physics-informed_2023,lino_current_2023}. Particularly, in the field of geophysics \citep{yu_deep_2021,lin_physics-guided_2023}. 

Due to the extensive areas where wave equation modeling is applied, our aim is to review the recent progress achieved in wave propagation modeling by employing these emerging techniques, specially on geophysics. Additionally out the this review may be of help for researchers with interest into apply these emerging techniques.

This will provide a comprehensive analysis of the advancements made and their impact. While this area can be applied to a wide range of problems, their context will be limited to the propagation of mechanical waves. This work is organized into the following sections: Section \ref{sec:fordward_inverse_modeling_mechanical_waves} aims to review the fundamentals of mechanical wave propagation modeling. Furthermore, in Sections \ref{sec:tnm} and \ref{sec:dl_mwpm}, we identify existing traditional and deep learning methods used to solve the wave equation, and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in comparison to each other. Additionally, we examine the recent advances in mechanical wave propagation modeling achieved through these methods. Finally, in section \ref{sec:final_remarks_and_perspectives}, we discuss possible challenges and opportunities.

\section{Forward and Inverse Modeling of Mechanical Wave Propagation}\label{sec:fordward_inverse_modeling_mechanical_waves}
 
 
A dynamic model, such as propagation of waves in a medium, describes how a system changes over time. This is different from a static model, which shows how a system is at equilibrium. Dynamic models typically use differential equations to describe how a system evolves over time. A general formulation of the governing equation of a physical problem can be:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
D(\boldsymbol{u}(x); \lambda) &= f(x), & \quad x &\in \Omega,\\\label{eq:pde}
B_k(\boldsymbol{u}(x)) &= g_k(x), & \quad x &\in  \partial\Omega,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\

for $k = 1, 2, ..., n_k,$ where $D$ is a differential operator parameterized by $\lambda$, $B_k$ is a set of boundary operators, $u \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the solution to the differential equation, and $f(x)$ is a source term. Equation \ref{eq:pde} can be used to model different systems.  

Two general approaches when mathematically modeling a system are the inverse and forward problems. The process of determining the causes of a set of observations is known as the inverse problem \citep{Tarantola}, aiming to infer, for example, the properties of a medium based on its reaction to mechanical wave propagation. Since it begins with the effects and then calculates the causes, it is the opposite of a forward problem, which determines the effects based on the causes. In most cases, the inverse problem is formulated by iteratively performing forward modeling to infer the causes that produce a desired effect, making it computationally complex.


Inverse problems are closely tied to simulation, and solving them is crucial for many real-world tasks. The objective is to estimate a set of latent or unobserved parameters of a system based on real-world observations. Within the framework described by Equation \ref{eq:pde}, the task involves estimating $\lambda$ given $u$. Inversion can be exceedingly challenging since often requires numerous forward simulations to align the predictions of the physical model with the set of observations. 

The differential equations of interest in this review are those who establish a mathematical description of the mechanical wave propagation. We initially consider a continuous medium with a domain $\Omega$ and a boundary $\Gamma$ is considered. Denoting by $\mathbf{r}$ the position vector defined at time $ t $ within the interval $(0, T)$, where $ T > 0 $ and $ T \in \mathbb{R} $, we introduce: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\Omega} &= \Omega \cup \Gamma, &\quad
Q_T &= \Omega \times (0,T), &\quad
\sum_T &= \Gamma \times (0,T).
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $x_k$; $k  \in {1, 2, 3}$ are Cartesian coordinates and $t$ is time. Despite being the most elementary between mechanical wave equations, the scalar (acoustic) wave equation is widely used to study seismic waves and in medical applications \citep{alkhadhr_wave_2023}. The second order linear wave equation, in an homogeneous medium, is expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t^2} =  c^{2} \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial x_i} + f_i  \ .
\label{acustic}
\end{equation}

Another common expression used to describe the propagation of seismic waves, for the case of a heterogeneous isotropic medium, can be described by the elastic wave equation

\begin{equation}
\rho \frac{\partial^2 \boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t^2}=\nabla \lambda(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u})+\nabla \mu\left[\nabla \boldsymbol{u}+(\nabla \boldsymbol{u})^T\right]+(\lambda+2 \mu) \nabla(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u})-\mu \nabla \times \nabla \times \boldsymbol{u}
\label{elastic}
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the material density, $\boldsymbol{u}$ is the displacement, and $\lambda, \mu$ are the Lamé parameters characterizing the material. 

\section{Traditional Numerical Methods to Solve Partial differential Equations}\label{sec:tnm}

In the past 5 decades various numerical methods have been proposed to solve physics systems by partial differential equations such as the wave equation. An schematic representation of the forward and inverse model using numerical methods is shown in Figure \ref{fig:forward_inverse}.

\begin{figure*}[tb!]
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{figs/forward_inverse_modeling.pdf}
    \caption{Scheme of the forward and inverse problems encountered in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). In the forward scenario, the inputs $(x,\lambda)$ are employed to characterize a model across PDEs. Subsequently, the PDEs are resolved through either traditional numerical methods (TNM) or deep learning methods (DL) to derive a solution $u$. Traditional numerical methods sucha as: finite differences (FD), finite elements (FE), pseudo-spectral (PS), finite volumes (FV), and spectral elements (SE). Also, deep learning techniques include, for example, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the case of the inverse problem, the objective is to determine the parameters $(x,\lambda)$ starting from the solution $u$.}
    \label{fig:forward_inverse}
\end{figure*}

The finite-difference method is among the most popular to solve partial differential equations, and particularly the wave equation. A complete review of the finite-differences method applied to wave propagation can be found the \citeauthoryear{Moczo2014}. Partial derivatives are approximated by discrete operators involving differences between adjacent grid points. The finite difference method suits for tackling issues related to simple geometric structures. In contrast, the finite element method offers more grid flexibility, facilitating the handling of intricate geometric boundaries.

In wave propagation simulations, the partial differential equations are typically discretized on a staggered grid \citep{Virieux1986}. This approach facilitates the resolution of the rupture propagation problem. Particularly an approach was proposed in the work of \citeauthoryear{Zhou2021} a finite-difference method with variable-length temporal and spatial operators was proposed to increase the stability and efficiency of the traditional method.

\citeauthoryear{liu_simulation_2023} combined a standard staggered-grid (SSG), finite-difference (FD) approach and the perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary to solve 3D first-order velocity-stress equations of acoustoelasticity to simulate wave propagating.

Finite-element methods are suitable for dealing with intricate shapes and diverse materials because they can use irregular grids. They permit flexibility in size, shape, and approximation order. Nevertheless, a drawback is their high demand for computing power. This methodology involves the transformation of the problem at hand into a system of linear equations utilizing the weak formulation of the pertinent differential equation. This transformation is facilitated by employing an interpolation basis comprised of polynomials defined over disjoint domains, commonly referred to as elements.

In general, a significant difficulty in using traditional methods for wave propagation simulations is their computational cost. For example, finite-difference modeling can entail millions of grid points, with the wavefield requiring iterative updates across the entire grid at each time step. Large-scale simulations are typically executed on supercomputer clusters, and real-time simulation is usually unattainable. Shortening simulation time would benefit many applications. The realm of deep learning has recently displayed promise in its capacity to approximate predictions of physical phenomena. These methods can grasp highly nonlinear physics and offer significantly quicker inference times compared to conventional simulations. Therefore, as an alternative to traditional methods deep learning have been employed to apply their capability as universal function approximator.

\section{Deep Learning for Mechanical Wave Propagation Modeling}\label{sec:dl_mwpm}




Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, whose models are composed of an artificial neural network with multiple processing layers (Figure \ref{deep_learning_subset_architecture}.A). It have shown potential in overcoming the limitations of multiple approaches in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and genomics \citep{lecun_deep_2015,goodfellow_deep_2016}. The fundamental architecture of a deep neural network architecture is conformed by an input layer, an output layer, and an arbitrary number of hidden layers. In a fully connected neural network, neurons in adjacent layers are connected with each other but neurons within a single layer share no connection (Figure \ref{deep_learning_subset_architecture}.B). Furthermore, deep learning methods have emerged as an attractive tool to augment and complement conventional numerical solvers of partial differential equations, thereby enabling the tackling of challenges across multiple dimensions, scales, and parameterization with the promise of efficiency and precision \citep{blechschmidt_three_2021}. 

 
\begin{figure*}
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{figs/deep_learning_subset_architecture.pdf}
    \caption{Deep learning method. (A) Deep learning as a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence and (B) basic architecture of artificial neural networks.}
    \label{deep_learning_subset_architecture}
\end{figure*}

 
Data-driven neural networks methods are capable of directly learning the trajectory of a system of partial differential equations from available data \citep{li_neural_2020,li_fourier_2021}.

One of the most popular types of deep neural networks is known as convolutional neural networks. A convolutional neural network convolves learned features with input data, and uses 2D convolutional layers, making this architecture well suited to processing 2D data, such as images.





 All these approaches employ machine learning algorithms and others such as support vector machines, random forests, Gaussian processes have been also applied to model physical systems. However, they are implemented mainly as black-box tools. The constructed neural network can be thought of being ignorant of the mathematical description of the physical phenomenon. In order to overcome this limitation physics-informed neural networks architectures have been proposed. Where the activation and the loss functions are designed according to the context of the problem.

There has been an increasing interest in leveraging physics-informed neural networks since the published work of \citeauthoryear{Raissi2019}. Although similar ideas for constraining neural networks using physical laws have been explored in previous studies \citep{lagaris_artificial_1998}. The general principle of physics-informed neural networks is to integrate deep neural networks and physical laws to learn the underlying consistent dynamics from small or zero labeled data \citep{karniadakis_physics-informed_2021}.

Physics-informed neural networks aim to address physical systems governed by the equation

$$
N[u(t, x); \lambda] = 0,
$$

\

where \(x \in \mathbb{R}^D\) and \(t \in \mathbb{R}\). The expression \(N[u(t, x); \lambda]\) denotes an underlying differential operator that characterizes the physical system, parametrized by \(\lambda\). The function \(u(t, x)\) represents the system's solution.


The introduction of physics-informed neural networks has generated a large amount of work related. For example the work of \citeauthoryear{karimpouli_physics_2020} explores the application of deep learning in geosciences, specifically solving the 1-dimensional time-dependent seismic wave equation. Comparing Gaussian process and physics-informed neural networks, the research shows that these meshless methods, requiring smaller datasets, effectively incorporate physics laws, with Gaussian process excelling in solution prediction and the neural network proving superior in velocity and density inversion. Their significant potential lies in addressing surrogate modeling and inverse analysis, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency \citep{Song2022}. \citeauthoryear{rash_2022} took a similar approach, but extending to 2D heterogeneous acoustic media, showing that PINNs could invert for ellipsoidal and checkerboard velocity models given the seismic response from sources placed within these models.

\citep{alkhadhr_modeling_2021}


In \citeauthoryear{moseley_physics-informed_2022}, physics-informed neural networks were successfully applied to the 2D acoustic wave equation, demonstrating satisfactory outcomes in forward wave propagation and full waveform inversions, despite the efficiency of traditional methods. Additionally, physics-informed neural networks showcased efficient performance in solving the inverse problem. Similarly, in \citeauthoryear{ren_seismicnet_2024}, physics-informed neural networks were employed for modeling mechanical wave propagation in semi-infinite domains, showcasing their versatility in forward modeling for seismic wave propagation, without requiring labeled data. These studies collectively highlight the effectiveness of physics-informed neural networks across different wave propagation scenarios.

\citep{wu_helmholtz-equation_2023}

\citeauthoryear{kharazmi_variational_2019} proposed variational physics-informed neural networks which instead trained physics-informed neural networks using the variational form of the underlying differential equations. Their neural network was still used to approximate the solution of the differential equation, but it was combined with a set of analytical test functions to compute the residual of the variational form of the equation in its physics loss term. Furthermore, they used quadrature points to estimate the corresponding integrals in the variational loss, rather than random collocation points. They found that the variational physics-informed neural networks was able to solve differential equations including Poisson’s equation with similar or better accuracy to a physics-informed neural networks trained using the strong form, whilst requiring less collocation points to train.

The order of differential operators can be effectively reduced by proper integrationby-parts, which reduces the required regularity in the (nonlinear) solution space.




\section{Final remarks and future perspectives}\label{sec:final_remarks_and_perspectives}

\subsection{Challenges}

One major drawback of these methods is the difficulty of transferring knowledge between different configurations. For example, when solving the wave equation, CNNs and PINNs are trained with a fixed velocity parameter and cannot predict anything for a different velocity value.

One of the main challenges in numerically modeling mechanical is associated with the dimensional, given the computational complexity. Most of the applications are implemented in one dimensional or two-dimensional domains. In \citeauthoryear{lehmann_fourier_2023} the Fourier Neural Operator method is applied to model sesimic waves.

It's important to notice that deep learning methods shouldn't be seen as substitutes for traditional numerical techniques used in solving partial differential equations. These established methods have been refined over decades and often fulfill the robustness and computational efficiency criteria needed in real-world applications. Also, we focus this review on medical and biophysical applications but the methods revised here can be implemented on other fields, whose physical system modeling require the use of the wave equation.

Moreover, the machine learning methods informed by physics are analyzed as current possible research path in the wave propagation problem.

% \section{Mathematical modeling of mechanical wave propagation}

% Two possible scientific modeling approaches are the forward and inverse modeling. The process of determining the causes of a set of observations is known as the inverse problem,\cite{Tarantola} aiming to infer, for example, the properties of a medium based on its reaction to mechanical wave propagation.

In most cases, the inverse problem is formulated by iteratively performing forward modeling to infer the causes that produce a desired effect. Forward modeling can be described mathematically as:

% \begin{equation}
% u = \mathcal{F}(x; \lambda),
% \label{eq:forward}
% \end{equation}

% where \(x,\lambda\) is a set of input conditions of the system, \(\mathcal{F}\) defines a physical model of the system, and \(u\) is a set of resulting properties of the system given \(\mathcal{F}\) and \(x,k\). For various systems, forward modeling aims to solve a set of differential equations. The system can be described by

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
% D[u(x); \lambda] &= f(x), & \quad x &\in \Omega,\\
% B_k[u(x)] &= g_k(x), & \quad x &\in \Gamma_k \subset \partial\Omega,
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}

% for $k = 1, 2, ..., n_b,$ where $D$ is a differential operator, $B_k$ is a set of boundary operators, $u \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the solution to the differential equation, and $f(x)$ is a forcing term. Inverse problems are closely tied to simulation, and solving them is crucial for many real-world tasks. The objective is to estimate a set of latent or unobserved parameters of a system based on real-world observations. Within the framework described by Equation \ref{eq:forward}, the task involves estimating a given $b$. Inversion can be exceedingly challenging since often requires numerous forward simulations to align the predictions of the physical model with the set of observations.


% The set of partial differential equations considered in this work are those who establish a mathematical description of the mechanical wave propagation. Initially, a continuous medium with a domain $\Omega$ and a boundary $\Gamma$ is considered.

% Q_T &= \Omega \times (0,T), &\quad
% \sum_T &= \Gamma \times (0,T).
% \end{aligned}
% $$

% Here $x_k$; $k  \in {1, 2, 3}$ are Cartesian coordinates and $t$ is time. The displacement vector is:

% \begin{equation*}
% u(r,t) = [u_1(r,t), \tilde{u}(r,t), u_3(r,t)] \in \mathbb{R}^3 \times [0, T] \times \mathbb{R}; \quad i = 1, 2, 3
% \end{equation*}


% Let $\varepsilon_{ij}$ denote the strain tensor, defined as $\varepsilon_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i} \right)$, where $i, j \in {1, 2, 3}$, and $\sigma_{ij}$ represents the stress tensor. The displacement–stress formulation for isotropic media is given by:

% \begin{equation}
% \rho \frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial t^2} - \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial x_j} - f_i = 0
% \label{displacement-stress}
% \end{equation}


% where $\rho(x_i)$ is the density in a spatial coordinate ($x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$).the stress--strain relation can be written using Lam\'e constants $\lambda$ and $\mu$ in the form $\sigma_{ij} = \lambda \varepsilon_{kk} \delta_{ij} + 2\mu \varepsilon_{ij}$. Replacing the displacement by its time derivative, the velocity vector, $v_i = \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t}$ in equation  \ref{displacement-stress}:\\

% \begin{equation}
% \rho \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial x_j} - f_i = 0
% \label{velocity-stress}
% \end{equation}

% which is known as the velocity-stress formulation. In the uni-dimensional case, of a homogeneous medium, the equation \ref{displacement-stress} simplifies (omitting the force term):

% \begin{equation}
% \rho \frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial t^2} - c^{2} \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial x_j} - f_i = 0 \ .
% \label{scalar}
% \end{equation}

% Particularly, the 2D the constant-density acoustic wave equation is given by


% \begin{equation}
% \rho \frac{\partial^2 u_2}{\partial t^2} - c^{2} \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial x_j} - f_i = 0 \ .

\section{Mathematical formulation of forward and inverse modeling of mechanical wave propagation}

% Two possible scientific approaches are the forward and inverse modeling. The process of determining the causes of a set of observations is known as the inverse problem,\cite{Tarantola} aiming to infer, for example, the properties of a medium based on its reaction to mechanical wave propagation. Since it begins with the effects and then calculates the causes, it is the opposite of a forward problem, which determines the effects based on the causes. In most cases, the inverse problem is formulated by iteratively performing forward modeling to infer the causes that produce a desired effect. Forward modeling can be described mathematically as:

% \begin{equation}
% u = \mathcal{F}(x; \lambda),
% \label{eq:forward}
% \end{equation}

% where \(x,\lambda\) is a set of input conditions of the system, \(\mathcal{F}\) defines a physical model of the system, and \(u\) is a set of resulting properties of the system given \(\mathcal{F}\) and \(x,k\). For various systems, forward modeling aims to solve a set of differential equations. The system can be described by

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
% D[u(x); \lambda] &= f(x), & \quad x &\in \Omega,\\
% B_k[u(x)] &= g_k(x), & \quad x &\in \Gamma_k \subset \partial\Omega,
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}

% for $k = 1, 2, ..., n_b,$ where $D$ is a differential operator, $B_k$ is a set of boundary operators, $u \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the solution to the differential equation, and $f(x)$ is a forcing term. Inverse problems are closely tied to simulation, and solving them is crucial for many real-world tasks. The objective is to estimate a set of latent or unobserved parameters of a system based on real-world observations. Within the framework described by Equation \ref{eq:forward}, the task involves estimating a given $b$. Inversion can be exceedingly challenging since often requires numerous forward simulations to align the predictions of the physical model with the set of observations. 


% Adjoint methods provide an efficient strategy to reduce the computational cost of the inversion problem from $N$ forward simulations per optimization step ($N$ = number of model parameters) to just two forward simulations. However, deriving and implementing adjoint methods remains a challenge and requires a specific approach for each system.


% The set of partial differential equations considered in this work are those who establish a mathematical description of the mechanical wave propagation. Initially, a continuous medium with a domain $\Omega$ and a boundary $\Gamma$ is considered. Denoting by $\mathbf{r}$ the position vector defined at time $ t $ within the interval $(0, T)$, where $ T > 0 $ and $ T \in \mathbb{R} $, we introduce:

% $$
% \begin{aligned}
% \hat{\Omega} &= \Omega \cup \Gamma, &\quad
% Q_T &= \Omega \times (0,T), &\quad
% \sum_T &= \Gamma \times (0,T).
% \end{aligned}
% $$

% Here $x_k$; $k  \in {1, 2, 3}$ are Cartesian coordinates and $t$ is time. The displacement vector is:

% \begin{equation*}
% u(r,t) = [u_1(r,t), \tilde{u}(r,t), u_3(r,t)] \in \mathbb{R}^3 \times [0, T] \times \mathbb{R}; \quad i = 1, 2, 3
% \end{equation*}


% Let $\varepsilon_{ij}$ denote the strain tensor, defined as $\varepsilon_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i} \right)$, where $i, j \in {1, 2, 3}$, and $\sigma_{ij}$ represents the stress tensor. The displacement–stress formulation for isotropic media is given by:

% \begin{equation}
% \rho \frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial t^2} - \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial x_j} - f_i = 0
% \label{displacement-stress}
% \end{equation}


% where $\rho(x_i)$ is the density in a spatial coordinate ($x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$).the stress--strain relation can be written using Lam\'e constants $\lambda$ and $\mu$ in the form $\sigma_{ij} = \lambda \varepsilon_{kk} \delta_{ij} + 2\mu \varepsilon_{ij}$. Replacing the displacement by its time derivative, the velocity vector, $v_i = \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t}$ in equation  \ref{displacement-stress}:\\

% \begin{equation}
% \rho \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial x_j} - f_i = 0
% \label{velocity-stress}
% \end{equation}

% which is known as the velocity-stress formulation. In the uni-dimensional case, of a homogeneous medium, the equation \ref{displacement-stress} simplifies (omitting the force term):

% \begin{equation}
% \rho \frac{\partial^2 u_i}{\partial t^2} - c^{2} \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial x_j} - f_i = 0 \ .
% \label{scalar}
% \end{equation}

% Particularly, the 2D the constant-density acoustic wave equation is given by


% \begin{equation}
% \rho \frac{\partial^2 u_2}{\partial t^2} - c^{2} \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial x_j} - f_i = 0 \ .
% \label{acustic}
% \end{equation}

% The upcoming sections outline the prevailing methodologies widely utilized for both forward and inverse modeling, accompanied by notable advancements associated with them. An schematic representation of the forward and inverse model is shown in Figure \ref{fig:forward_inverse}.

% \begin{figure*}
%     \centering    \includegraphics{figs/forward_inverse.pdf}
%     \caption{Scheme of the forward and inverse problems encountered in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). In the forward scenario, the inputs $(x,\lambda)$ are employed to characterize a model across PDEs. Subsequently, the PDEs are resolved through either numerical methods (NM) or machine learning (ML) to derive a solution $u$. Numerical methods encompass finite differences (FD), finite elements (FE), pseudo-spectral (PS), finite volumes (FV), and spectral elements (SE). Machine learning techniques include Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the case of the inverse problem, the objective is to determine the parameters $(x,\lambda)$ starting from the solution $u$.}

% \section{Numeric methods to solve the wave propagation problem}

% \subsection{Finite-differences method formulation}

% The finite-difference method is among the most popular to solve partial differential equations, and particularly the wave equation. A complete review of the finite-differences method applied to wave propagation can be found the \citet{Moczo2014} and \citet{Seriani2020}. Partial derivatives are approximated by discrete operators involving differences between adjacent grid points. The derivative of a function $f$ is defined as:\\

% \begin{center}
% $
% \frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{dx \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + dx)-f(x)}{dx}
% $ , $
% \frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{dx \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + dx)-f(x -dx)}{2dx}
% $ or $
% \frac{df}{dx} = \lim_{dx \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x)-f(x -dx)}{2dx} \ .
% $
% \end{center}


% Considering the Taylor series expansion:



% Then, the approximation schemes of finite-difference derivative, using the Taylor series expansion, are:\\

% \begin{center}
% $
% \frac{df}{dx}^{+} \approx \frac{f(x + dx)-f(x)}{dx}
% $ , $
% \frac{df}{dx}^{c} \approx  \frac{f(x + dx)-f(x -dx)}{2dx}
% $ and $
% \frac{df}{dx}^{-} \approx \frac{f(x)-f(x -dx)}{2dx}
% $
% \end{center}

% Also, the second-order approximation:\

% $$
% \frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}} \approx \frac{f(x+dx)-2f(x)+f(x -dx)}{dx} \ .  
% $$

% \

% The following notation is considered for the discrete case of spatial and temporal variables:\

% $$
% u(x,t) \rightarrow u_{j}^{n}
% $$

% \


%  which is also called an \emph{structured grid}. Thus, equation \ref{scalar} can be expressed as:\\

%  $$
% \frac{u_{j}^{n+1} - 2 u_{j}^{n} + u_{j}^{n-1}}{dt^2} = c_{j}^2 \left[ \frac{u_{j}^{n+1} - 2 u_{j}^{n} + u_{j}^{n-1}}{dx^2} \right]  + s_{j}^n
%  $$

% then,

% $$
% u_{j}^{n+1} = \left( c_{j} \frac{dt}{dx} \right)^2 \left[ u_{j+1}^{n} - 2 u_{j}^{n} + u_{j-1}^{n}\right] + 2 u_{j}^{n} - u_{j}^{n-1} + dt^{2} s_{j}^{n}
% $$

% Thanks to the great progress of artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning, many scientists start to explore the potential of using ML to address problems such as mechanical wave propagation.

% Alternative machine learning approaches for predicting physical systems employ various algorithms of machine learning, being the lack of interpretability and the huge amount of data required common disadvantages. In most cases, machine learning learning algorithms are assumed as a black box.


% A notable advantage of PINNs method lies in its ability to formulate tailored loss and activation functions derived from the implemented physical model.\cite{Raissi2019}

% Their significant potential lies in addressing surrogate modeling and inverse analysis, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.\cite{Song2022}

% The method have shown effectiveness in inverse problems in the context of acoustic wave equations.%\cite{rash_2022}

% PINNs aim to address physical systems governed by the equation
% \[
% N[u(t, x); \lambda] = 0,
% \]
% where \(x \in \mathbb{R}^D\) and \(t \in \mathbb{R}\). The expression \(N[u(t, x); \lambda]\) denotes an underlying differential operator that characterizes the physical system, parametrized by \(\lambda\). The function \(u(t, x)\) represents the system's solution.

% The introduction of PINNs has generated a large amount of work related. For example the work of \cite{karimpouli_physics_2020} explores the application of deep learning in geosciences, specifically solving the 1-dimensional time-dependent seismic wave equation. Comparing Gaussian process and physics-informed neural networks, the research shows that these meshless methods, requiring smaller datasets, effectively incorporate physics laws, with Gaussian process excelling in solution prediction and the neural network proving superior in velocity and density inversion.


% In , PINNs were successfully applied to the 2D acoustic wave equation, demonstrating satisfactory outcomes in forward wave propagation and full waveform inversions (FWIs), despite the efficiency of traditional methods. Additionally, PINNs showcased efficient performance in solving the inverse problem. Similarly, in \cite{ren_seismicnet_2024}, PINNs were employed for modeling mechanical wave propagation in semi-infinite domains, showcasing their versatility in forward modeling for seismic wave propagation, without requiring labeled data. These studies collectively highlight the effectiveness of PINNs across different wave propagation scenarios.
